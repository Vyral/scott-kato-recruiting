I know how challenging it is to sell real estate. That’s why I want to talk to you about what I can do to help get your career on the right track.

There are discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients. All are not equal, and **it can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent plan**. I will meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan that you can immediately use to generate leads, appointments, and sales.

My name is Scott Kato and I’ve sold over 1,500 homes to date. I want to help you sell more homes, too. I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes. I’ll also share what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales.

Once I understand how you like to do business, whether it be by referral, prospecting, or marketing-based. **I’ll help you write a business plan tailored for you** and you’ll walk away with a plan of action with steps you can take right away to find homeowners who want to sell their home and list with you. This will help you get the freedom that we all want from our business.

I’ll help you for free on the condition that, over the long-term, and only if it makes sense, you'd like to learn more about working at our brokerage. Let me be clear: That’s another conversation for another time, if you have an interest.

I also figure we’ll do business together someday one way or another, and **I’d like to get to know you**. I like seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.

I’d like you to request a one-on-one business consultation with me below. We can meet for coffee, a phone call, or a video conference. When you request a call, I’ll email you a sheet to complete before our time together so that I’m prepared to offer you specific advice.

If you have any other questions for me about the business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
