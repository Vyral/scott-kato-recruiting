"Scott is one of the most innovative and forward-thinking leaders I have met. Specifically, I don’t know anyone who is better suited to help agents grow their business and transition their business (which at the end of the day STILL is a people business) into a new age where technology assists agents.

If you are a tech wizard; Scott can help you. If you know nothing at all about tech; Scott can guide you to simple ways to improve your business.

Lastly, Scott has himself grow his own real estate team from 'very good' to 'world class'—this is who I would pick as a coach if I were anywhere from a very seasoned agent to someone looking to grow a new business. I stake my 15 years reputation on everything I just said\!\!\!\!"

\- Paul Morris, CEO Forward Living (KW’s 2nd largest franchise group); OP KW Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills, and Studio City and KW Regional Owner and Regional Director for KW Central and Southern CA Regions.
