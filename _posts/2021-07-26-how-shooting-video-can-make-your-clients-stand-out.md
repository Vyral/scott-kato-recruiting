It’s no secret that the market is on fire. With low interest rates, low inventory, and high demand, things aren’t showing any sign of slowing down. The question is, in this crazy market, what are you doing to make sure your clients’ offers are accepted?

**My most important piece of advice is to build a strong rapport with the listing agent**. Whenever we’re scheduling an appointment, we should be focused on building rapport. We all know to ask questions like, “how many offers do you have?”, but what happens when the agent doesn’t return our calls or answer our texts?

To build rapport with listing agents, **we should be leveraging video whenever we make an offer**. The tools we use are called BombBomb, and they make it easy to tell a story about our amazing clients. Video is a great tool because it allows listing agents and sellers to get a feel for our humanity. The way we speak, the way we dress, and the tone of our voice are all key components that help us connect with agents on a deeper level.

The key is to **answer the question, “What would it be like to open escrow with this agent?”** Price is an important part of any transaction, but how easy an agent thinks you will be to work with can be equally important. Video is your opportunity to show them you’ll be personable instead of antagonistic.

The bottom line is, video helps you stay at the front of agents’ minds. Think about how many videos you have received from buyers. It’s probably not many, so when one does come through, it really stands out. Just last week, my clients were contingent on purchasing their replacement property. While their property was in escrow, it wasn’t a done deal. When I shot my video with BombBomb, I expressed that my clients planned to live in their home the way the owners had. I expressed their humanity, and that made them stand out among the faceless investors planning to rent out their triplex.

**Even though our offer was contingent on the sale of my client’s home, we made it into the top three offers for the property**. Not only that, the listing agent specifically reached out and complimented me on my video and professionalism. Despite my client’s situation, I was able to secure a counteroffer for my clients and keep them in the running for the property.

If you have any questions about BombBomb or if you would like to attend any of our training meetings, do not hesitate to reach out. I am always willing to help.
