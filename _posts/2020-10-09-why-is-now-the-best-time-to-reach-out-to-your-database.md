<center><em>Learn how to lean on your database in Q4 to jumpstart your 2021 success.</em></center>

<br>To achieve a business worth owning, we need to work with and succeed in our relationships. **It’s the referral business that keeps us going strong regardless of market conditions**. You may have heard about the 33-touch system through “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent,” but here at the Kato Group, we have a 66-touch program; for the last five or six years, our touch program has seen steady year-over-year increases.

The fourth quarter is when we make our biggest push to ensure that the coming year starts off on the right foot. Due to COVID-19, there are still stay-at-home orders in place for specific areas. In L.A. County, for example, tricking-or-treating will not be allowed this year. That’s a bummer, but **our team recognized a great opportunity to pop by and say hello to all of our past clients, sphere of influence, and anyone who has ever directed business our way**.

We’re going to put together a nice little bag of assorted candy—the sour ones are my favorite—for individuals in our database, and we’re also giving them a pumpkin\! All of our agents will pick 20 to 30 people (past clients, sphere of influence, people who have provided referrals) and deliver this fun October care package to their door.

It will be as simple as knocking on the door and saying, “Hey, just wanted to pop by and let you know I was thinking of you. It’s unfortunate that the kids can’t go trick-or-treating during this time, so I just wanted to bring some cheer to you guys.”

This is just an example of something simple yet thoughtful that you can do this fourth quarter; **now is the time to reach out to your database\!** What if you’re delivering a gift bag and the client isn’t home? Set the bag on their doorstep along with a salutation, like a little greeting card. Then, snap a selfie with all of the goods in the background and text that photo to your clients with the aforementioned greeting. That’s it—nothing too crazy\!

In November, with Thanksgiving around the corner, we usually have a client appreciation party that serves over a hundred of our past clients. To prepare, we go to Costco and buy a pallet of pumpkin pies. The event is hosted in a country club, and attendees can enjoy hors d'oeuvres, a hot cocoa stand for the kids, a coloring contest, a photographer, and a face painter.

Again, with COVID-19, this type of event is not viable. That’s why this year, we’re going back to the old-school approach—we’re buying all of the pumpkin pies and delivering every single one by hand. In December, we’ll be doing the same thing but with poinsettias. That’s three total touches in just the fourth quarter alone to ensure that our 2021 starts off hot.

Hopefully this provided you with some Q4 inspiration. If there’s a topic that you’d like me to cover in a video, please let me know. If you’d like to attend any of our Zoom meetings or weekly masterminds, please visit my event page to register. See you next time\!
