<center><em>The fourth quarter is now the start of the new year for your business.</em></center>

<br>To have a successful new year, you need to have the blueprint laid out well in advance. It’s the fourth quarter of 2020, and **it’s time we plan for 2021**. For my real estate team, The Kato Group, we’re going to do our Team Advance 2021 event this October.

Since we haven’t been able to spend as much time together as we normally would due to COVID-19, our team decided to take things on the road. We rented out a large house in Palm Springs for three days for our Team Advance 2021, to which each team member will come prepared with their ‘1-3-5’—their one goal, three priorities, and five strategies to ensure they succeed.

**We’ll take every agent’s individual goals and roll them up into one big team goal** for 2021. We’re going to bulletproof the plan and make sure that, come November 1, we’ve completely fleshed out a blueprint for a successful 2021. From there, we’ll take all of those line items and plug them into our calendars so we can time block effectively. This enables us to see what we need to be doing day by day, week by week, and month by month to hit our yearly goal.

Perhaps your 2021 team planning event will simply involve your team gathering at a restaurant or creative space to break bread and earnestly discuss your shared goals. At the end of your team’s strategizing, make time for something fun. For example, this year our team is looking forward to hanging out together by the pool, barbecuing, and having a few drinks in our Palm Springs rental. If we can, we’ll squeeze in some golf, too\!

No matter how you structure it, **your planning session needs to be a priority**. Here’s a pro tip for you: Train yourself to see November 1 as the new January 1. That way, you’ll hit the phones and your lead generation activities hard come November 1 to pack your pipeline with plenty of opportunities so you hit the ground running when the calendar turns over for real.

Hopefully, this provided you with some Q4 inspiration. If there’s a topic that you’d like me to cover in a video, please let me know.
