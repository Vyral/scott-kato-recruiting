“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” What does that saying have to do with real estate? Have you ever wondered how many dials it takes to make a contact or how many contacts it takes to get an appointment? More importantly, how many appointments does it take to open an escrow?

We call these numbers the scoreboard, and if you don’t know the score of the game, how do you know if you’re winning or losing? In NBA basketball, there’s always a winner and a loser; it’s the same thing for NFL football, boxing, and all the rest—there always has to be a winner. **We track all of our activities, contacts, and other crucial information through a CRM** system that connects to a third-party software called Sisu. Sisu will track all of our contacts, appointments, and so on, so any of our agents can figure out critical numbers such as how many contacts it takes for them to get an appointment and how many appointments it takes to get to an escrow.

**The data will tell a story.** For example, if you make plenty of contacts but can’t set an appointment, that tells me you have a script problem—you don’t know how to get in front of the client. It might also be a lead generation issue: Who are you contacting, what are you saying, is the contact information good? If your set appointments are up but your escrows are stagnant or down, that tells me you’re having difficulties getting your clients to put pen to paper; you may not know how to ask for the sale.

**Tracking your numbers will help you identify areas of your business that need improvement.** If you don’t know the score, you’re always losing.
