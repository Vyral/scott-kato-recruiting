In [<u>the first part</u>](https://coachkato.com/why-contracts-and-disclosures-are-vital-to-understand.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of our “Top Producer Mastery” series, we talked about how to master contracts. Today I want to talk about getting to mastery level with scripts and why that’s so important.

**When we talk about scripts, most agents freeze up**. They get caught up with the memorization of talking points, and it feels awkward and uncomfortable. They think it sounds salesy and sleazy. I would say yes to all the above; it does feel unnatural. You’re learning something new that’s probably outside of your comfort zone.

Staying on course with scripts is not about learning a script so you can pull the wool over someone's eyes. It’s not about saying all the right things and having a prospect agree with everything you say. Scripts are there for you to internalize a conversation with a prospect across the table.

There are measure points to ask specific questions. **The goal is to get a prospect to feel comfortable** and have a conversation. You ask questions, you answer theirs, they feel like they're being heard. Once you build rapport, the level of trust increases.

The No. 1 rule to remember is that everyone in the world just wants to be heard. When you’re buying or selling the largest asset of your life, the last thing you want to feel is that you got sold something. These prospects are trying to figure out who they can trust and who will protect their best interests. The way to do that is by asking amazing questions. In return, you’ll get amazing answers.

**Scripts are not there to sweet talk someone** or sell them something they don’t want. They’re just measuring points to bring up in a conversation to get the prospect to open up, feel comfortable, and eventually trust you.

Stay tuned for the next episode in this series. In the meantime, reach out if you have questions about the business, your career, or anything else. I would love to hear from you.
