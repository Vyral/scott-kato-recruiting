There are 186 tasks you must do in order to take a contract to close—that’s a lot for a single agent to take on. Many realize they can get more done if they add other people to the team, but here’s the big mistake they’re making: **They’re hiring agents**.

It’s great for helping clients hit the escrow period, but then there are still those 186 tasks left to do. Who’s going to take care of them? Well, you’ll be the one responsible. You’re limiting yourself even more because you’re spending more of your precious time on the 80% of tasks that don’t make you money. Even worse, you’re giving away commissions to other agents.

Your first hire should be an admin who can take care of the busy work. This frees up your time and allows you to focus on the 20% of dollar-producing activities. Imagine having more time to generate leads and prospects, show homes to buyers, take on listings, and more. **You should only start hiring more agents when you can’t keep up with your leads on your own**.

If you have any questions or would like more information about growing your real estate business, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
