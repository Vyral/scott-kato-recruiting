<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent: </p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes? </p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<img src="/img/strat01.jpg" class="half-image"><br>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate. </p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you). </p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money. </p>

<p>My name is Scott Kato and I’ve sold over 1500 homes to date. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes. </p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes. </p>

<p>I’ll also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business <strong>that’s authentic to you</strong> (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc.), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you. </p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the <strong>commission consistency</strong> and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"Love working with Scott as my coach and mentor. He really takes the time to get to learn more about you and your business, and holds you accountable to the goals that you want to achieve. Since I’ve started coaching with Scott, I’ve implemented so many new systems in my business that I didn’t have before, and with his help, I’m taking my business from entrepreneurial to purposeful."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Danielle Corona Rosario</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"I've been coached/mentored by Scott since I started in real estate. From day one he has made it simple to identify my blind spots and help me focus on the most important areas of my business that would position me to succeed to the next level. Consistent accountability, always maintaining high-level communication throughout the process as a coach should."</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach. </p>

<p>Why am I offering this? </p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage. </p>

<img src="/img/strat04.jpg" class="half-image"><br>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest. </p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it. </p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<img src="/img/strat05.jpg" class="half-image"><br>


<p>I have a <strong>questionnaire</strong> I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting. </p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
