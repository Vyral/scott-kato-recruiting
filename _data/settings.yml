    Hello, my name is Scott Kato and Iâ€™ve been a licensed Realtor since 2003. By
    following the Millionaire Real Estate Agent (MREA) I stepped out of
    production in 2016 by implementing systems, models and hiring talent. The
    Kato Group consistently ranks as a top team in SoCal that helps over 100
    families a year, with a sales volume of $50M. Now that I have my time back,
    I focus my energy on launching profitable real estate offices, coaching my
    top agents, and continuing to bring value to our agents. My one thing is to
    prospect for like minded entrepreneurs just like you to join our World Class
    Culture.
